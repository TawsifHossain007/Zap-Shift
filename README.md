## Overview
This is a role-based parcel delivery management system with separate dashboards for users, admins, and riders.

Users can create parcel delivery requests and complete payments online. Admins manage all parcels from a central dashboard and assign deliveries to available riders based on region. Riders can view their assigned parcels and update delivery statuses such as Picked Up or Delivered in real time.

The system ensures a smooth delivery workflow with clear role separation, real-time status updates, and an intuitive dashboard experience for all users.
